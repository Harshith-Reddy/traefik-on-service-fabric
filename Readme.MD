# Running Traefik on Service Fabric

# What is Traefik?
Tr√¶fik (pronounced like traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer made to deploy microservices with ease. It supports several backends (Docker, Swarm mode, Kubernetes, Marathon, Consul, Etcd, Rancher, Amazon ECS, and a lot more) to manage its configuration automatically and dynamically.

# What is Service Fabric?
Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices and containers.

# Why run Traefik on Service Fabric?
Integrating Treafik and Service Fabric allows you to configure much more advanced, yet flexible, traffic routing scenarios for your Service Fabric hosted services and applications. You get all the benefits of using Treafik to configure your routing whilst also getting the benefits of Service Fabric's packaging model.

# How do I get started?
First things first, make sure you have a Service Fabric cluster up and running, either remotely or using the local development environment. Instructions on doing this can be found on the [Service Fabric documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/service-fabric/).

Once you have a Service Fabric cluster up and running, let's deploy a sample application so you have something to route traffic to. The [Service Fabric Getting Started Sample](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/service-fabric-dotnet-getting-started/) is a great starting point. This application contains services for each of the supported service types (Stateless services, Stateful services, Actors services and Guest Executable services [Currently there is no container service although Service Fabric does have support for this type of service]). Once you've deployed the sample application to your cluster we can get started working with Traefik.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    
    `git clone https://github.com/jjcollinge/traefik-on-service-fabric.git`

2. Download the Traefik binary into the solution by running the following powershell script.

    `./traefik-on-service-fabric/Traefik/Scripts/Get-TraefikBinary.ps1`

    This will use the build from this repository's releases. To override the download url, specify a `-url` parameter to the script with the URL of the Traefik windows binary you wish to download.

3. Open the `Traefik.sln` file in Visual Studio

    **If you're working against a local development cluster skip to step 10.**

4. Download or copy your clusters `.pfx` certificate file into the folder `traefik-on-service-fabric\Traefik\Scripts\`. If you have multiple certificates, this should be the one you wish Traefik to use to authenticate against your cluster's management endpoint. Ideally, this will be a `read-only` certificate.

5. Set your execution policy to unrestricted to allow the scripts to run

    `Set-ExectuionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser`

6. Create a passphrase ANSI text file with suitable permissions and write the `*.pfx` passphrase to it.

7. Please read the [Certificates section](#certificates) before running the `Create-Certs.ps1` script... ok read it? Run the `Create-Certs.ps1` script.

    `.\Create-Certs.ps1 -PfxCertFilePath <myclustercert.pfx> -PfxPassphraseFilePath <mypassphrase.txt>`

8. Copy your generated certificate to the folder Traefik expects to find them in        `traefik-on-service-fabric\Traefik\ApplicationPackageRoot\TraefikPkg\Code\certs`

    `cp .\certs\* ..\ApplicationPackageRoot\TraefikPkg\Code\certs\`

9. If you wish to track the new certificate files in Visual Studio, you'll need to add them to your solution by right clicking on the `ApplicationPackageRoot\TreafikPkg\Code\certs` folder and selecting `Add Existing Item...`, navigate to the certificates local on disk and select `Add`.

10. Edit the `traefik-on-service-fabric\Traefik\ApplicationPackageRoot\TraefikPkg\Code\traefik.toml` global configuration file. If you're using a secure cluster, uncomment the TLS configuration section and make sure you provide paths to your client certificate files. Finally, ensure the `clustermanagementurl` is set to the HTTP management endpoint for your Service Fabric cluster.

    ```toml
    ################################################################
    # Service Fabric provider
    ################################################################

    # Enable Service Fabric configuration backend
    [servicefabric]

    # Service Fabric Management Endpoint
    clustermanagementurl = "http://localhost:19080"

    # Service Fabric Management Endpoint API Version
    apiversion = "3.0"

    # Enable TLS connection.
    #
    # Optional
    #
    # [serviceFabric.tls]
    #   ca = "certs/ca.crt"
    #   cert = "certs/servicefabric.crt"
    #   key = "certs/servicefabric.key"
    #   insecureskipverify = true
    ```

11. You now have a choice (Yikes!). See [simple configuration](#simple-configuration) or [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) to review your options.

12. Once configured, you can simply publish Traefik from Visual Studio like any other Service Fabric service.

13. To be able to route traffic through the Traefik API and see the dashboard, you'll need to open up and map the relevant ports on the Azure Load Balancer. These ports default to 80 (API) and 9000 (Dashboard) and can be configured in `traefik-on-service-fabric\Traefik\ApplicationPackageRoot\TraefikPkg\Code\traefik.toml` and in the corresponding `ServiceManifest.xml`.

14. Once the deployment is complete, you should be able to visit the Traefik dashboard at http[s]://[clusterfqdn]:9000.

    ![img](Docs/Images/traefikonsf.png)

    You should see your frontends' and backends' configuration.

15. If you exposed a web service, you should now be able to route to it using your desired configuration i.e. a label of PathPrefix: /testservice will be available on http://[clusterfqdn]/testservice

!!note!!
Web applications that require linked static assets (.js, .css, image files) will fail to render when routed to via certain Traefik frontends. This is because the path on which the client is trying to grab those assets is relative to the web server serving the page which does not respect Traefik's routing rules. To fix this, Traefik passes the stripped path through to the backend web server in the the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header. The web server must use this header to prepend to any URLs that will be invoked from the client.

## How does it work?

Traefik is hosted as a Service Fabric Guest Executable. Traefik has a built in Service Fabric [provider](https://github.com/containous/traefik/tree/master/provider) which will query the Service Fabric management API to discover what services are currently being hosted in the cluster (referred to as `backends`). The provider then maps routing rules (known as `frontends`) across these `backends`. Traffic then flows in via `entrypoints` (http, https, etc.), the `frontends` are then applied to load balance and filter traffic to each `backend`. The provider will take into account the `Health` and `Status` of each of the services to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy service instances.

To learn more about the Traefik model of Frontends and Backends [see their documentation](https://docs.traefik.io/basics/).

## Simple Configuration [UPDATE IN PROGRESS]

The simplest way to expose a Service Fabric web service via Traefik is by using Service Fabric's `Extension` element in your `ServiceManifest.xml`. 

1. To expose a service on the path `/testservice`, simply add the `Extensions` section from below into your web service's `ServiceManifest.xml`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ServiceManifest Name="WebServicePkg"
                 Version="2.0.0"
                 xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric"
                 xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
                 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <ServiceTypes>
    <!-- This is the name of your ServiceType. 
         This name must match the string used in RegisterServiceType call in Program.cs. -->
    <StatelessServiceType ServiceTypeName="WebServiceType">
      <Extensions>
          <Extension Name="Traefik">
            <Labels xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2015/03/fabact-no-schema">
              <Label Key="traefik.frontend.rule.default">PathPrefixStrip: /testservice</Label>
              <Label Key="traefik.expose">true</Label>
              <Label Key="traefik.frontend.passHostHeader">true</Label>
            </Labels>
          </Extension>
      </Extensions>
    </StatelessServiceType>
  </ServiceTypes>

```

2. You can then override these extension properties at runtime using [Service Fabric's Property Management API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/servicefabric/sfclient-index-property-management). For example:

```
curl -X PUT \
  'http://localhost:19080/Names/GettingStartedApplication2/WebService/$/GetProperty?api-version=6.0&IncludeValues=true' \
  -d '{
  "PropertyName": "traefik.frontend.rule.default",
  "Value": {
    "Kind": "String",
    "Data": "PathPrefixStrip: /staging"
  },
  "CustomTypeId": "LabelType"
}'
```

The available labels are similar to those supported by the [Docker Provider](https://docs.traefik.io/configuration/backends/docker/). Review these for usage information, in future docs will be updated to detail SF specifics.

We plan to make interacting with the Service Fabric Property Management API available via a future release of [sfctl](https://github.com/Azure/service-fabric-cli).

## Advanced Configuration

Traefik has more advanced features than simple routing, including [Rate limiting](https://docs.traefik.io/basics/#backends) and [Circuit breakers](https://docs.traefik.io/basics/#backends) for backends and [Modifiers](https://docs.traefik.io/basics/#frontends) and [Matchers](https://docs.traefik.io/basics/#matchers) for frontends.

These can all be used and customised when deploying on Service Fabric through a configuration template file. The template file is used to generate a TOML file which configures the Traefik instance. Here are some [examples of Traefik TOML files](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/examples/).

To customise your TOML template file, simply edit or replace the default TOML template file located at `traefik-on-service-fabric\Traefik\ApplicationPackageRoot\TraefikPkg\Config\config.toml.tmpl`. Do this before you deploy Treafik for the first time, or use the `Update-Config.ps1` as shown in Step 15 to do an in-place config update.

When writing your custom template files, please note that the Service Fabric Traefik provider will dynamically inject your service endpoints as backend servers. This means you can add configuration such as load balancing rules which will be applied to the injected servers at runtime.

More detail on using the templates can be found [here](Docs/CustomTemplates.MD), along with [samples here](Docs/SampleTemplates).

## Certificates
The `Create-Certs.ps1` script is intended to help bootstrap a simple Traefik deployment to a Service Fabric cluster by generating PEM formatted certificate files from an existing `.pfx` certificate. However, it is not intended as a production-grade solution for securing Traefik.
I recommend you read the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-security-update-certs-azure) on managing certificates in Azure Service Fabric.

The Traefik provider only requires `Read-Only` access to the Service Fabric API and thus you should ideally use a `Read-Only` certificate.

**Warning:** The script currently has to unencrypt the .key file as the Traefik provider doesn't support encrypted client key files. We are working to rectify this. In the meantime, please be careful where you store the unencrypted .key file.
